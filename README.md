# GAN Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** built using Python and popular deep learning library **PyTorch**. 

Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks compete with each other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. 

## About the Project

This project implements a basic GAN architecture. The GAN consists of two models:
- **Generator**: Learns to generate new, plausible data.
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and fake data.

The aim is to make the generator create data that is indistinguishable from real data. The adversarial nature of the GAN training leads to impressive results in data generation tasks.
